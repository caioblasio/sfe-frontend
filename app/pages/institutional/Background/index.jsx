                      The two main medium to high-pressure extraction methods
                      that can be found in the literature are SFE (Supercritical
                      Fluid Extraction) and PLE (Pressurized Liquid Extraction).

                      SFE (Supercritical Fluid Extraction) is an extraction
                      method based upon the use of fluids in their supercritical
                      state as solvents. SFE has several advantages against
                      conventional extraction methods, such as: allowing the use
                      of eco-friendly, non-toxic and non-flammable solvents,
                      process flexibility in terms of solute-solvent affinity by
                      changes on the physical process conditions (temperature,
                      pressure) and easy extract isolation (no residual solvent
                      amounts in the final extract) (De La Fuente et al., 2005;
                      Reverchon & De Marco, 2006).

                      PLE (Pressurized Liquid Extraction), on other hand, takes
                      advantage of elevated pressures to keep the liquid state
                      of solvents despite the temperature levels above their
                      regular boiling point. Hence, this technique can be
                      interpreted as an alternative to the classic Sohxlet
                      solvent extraction (Herrero et al., 2013; Wianowska & Gil,
                      2019).

                      (ii) phases, as presented in Figure 2: the solvent flows

                      creating an interface where the solute will dissolve

                      convective fluid flow up to the top of the column before
                      the fluid phase is depressurized and the final extract is

                      The phenomena kinetics are mainly regulated by both the

                      a.k.a as â€˜Broken and Intact Cellsâ€™ model, it assumes that
                      the initial solute concentration x<small>0</small> is
                      distributed in two fractions: an easily accessible and
                      another one that resides inside the solid particles, x
                      <small>p</small> and x<small>k</small>
                      respectively). The kinetics are divided in three
                      consecutive phases: constant extraction rate (CER),
                      falling extraction rate (FER) and diffusive. The model is
                      based upon differential mass balances that result on
                      differential equations that can be solved either (i)
                      analytically as proposed by the model author initially, or
                      (ii) numerically as an alternative way.

                      model that interprets the extraction process as a series
                      of chemical reactions. As in SovovÃ¡ (1994), the solid is
                      divided is two portions x<small>p</small> and x
                      <small>k</small>. The mass-transfer is regulated by one
                      coefficient in the fluid phase k<small>1</small> and two
                      in the solid phase k<small>2</small> and k<small>3</small>
                      .
